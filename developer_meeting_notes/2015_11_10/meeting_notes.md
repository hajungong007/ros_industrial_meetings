**Notes:**

 -  Previous action items
     -  Developer list
         -  A seperate developer list will not be created.  Development discussion should take place of the ROS-I list (swri-ros-pkg-dev).  If the conversations become too numerous then a seperate list will be considred.
 -  New development
     -  Snappy Ubuntu Core
         -  What's required to make a snappy app: http://www.piware.de/2015/01/snappy-package-for-robot-operating-system-tutorial/
         -  Creat an "app" in the short term that demonstrates a single/simple capability of ROS-I on a specific plathform/configuration
         -  Identify a small computer platform (android, nvidia jetson, intel NUC, B&R PC) to be the Snappy/ROS "box"
         -  Possible apps
             -  CAD to ROS
             -  Monocular camera to robot calibration
             -  Palletizing
     -  OPC UA
         -  Being pushed by big industry partners (Kuka)
         -  New version of OPC (very different from old version)
         -  Real time version could serve as a replacement to existing fieldbuses
         -  IPA is going to have student work on replacing DDS in ROS 2.0 with OPC UA
     -  ROS 2.0
         -  Alpha 2 released - still just middleware
         -  Waiting for OSRF to give us the go ahead to port ROS-I (early adopter)
